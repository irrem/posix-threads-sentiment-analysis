Problem: Social Media Sentiment Analysis
Description: Social media platforms generate vast amounts of textual data in the form of tweets, posts, comments, and reviews. Your task is to design a shared memory MIMD system using POSIX threads to perform sentiment analysis on social media data and extract valuable insights.
You need to process social media data in a queued producer-consumer manner and gather data in a global data structure. Social media processing and sentimental analysis threads have to be separated and should communicate by queue pipelines


1. Data Collection: Gather social media data from various sources, such as Twitter, Facebook, or online forums. This can be done using APIs or web scraping techniques. Each thread in the shared memory MIMD system should handle a separate data source or stream.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected text data by removing noise, special characters, and irrelevant information. Apply techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to extract meaningful words.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to classify the sentiment of each text entry as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. Implement system with POSIX threads. For higher level operations (such as sentimental processing), you can show these parts with pseudo method names.
